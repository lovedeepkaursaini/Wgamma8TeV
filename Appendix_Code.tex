\subsection{Cross Checks}
We are doing cross checks between different analysts and Z$\gamma$ check. We cross checked muon
selection based on completely indepedent frameworks based on different ntuples (ggNtuples and
SUSY ntuples). We cross checked electron selection based on the same ntuples (ggNtuples) but
different analyzers. We are going through the template fit procedures for $jets \rightarrow \gamma$ background
estimation which are implemented by different people. To compare selection, we are using event-
by-event approach. However, this check is TODO (doesn’t pass all the tests). It doesn’t give
the same result for $\sigma_{i \eta i \eta}$ fits on MC mixture (exactly the same MC-mixture was used). And it
doesn’t give the same result for I ch fits for electron channel if use different (but cross-checked)
selection trees. Also, we are doing Z$\gamma$ check: applying all the same methods and procedures on
Z$\gamma$ selected events and are cross-checking with approved CMS Z$\gamma$ measurement [REFERENCE].
