Following approach used in Z$\gamma$ analysis.

==============================\\*
In Zg, results of Ipho and sihih template fits are treated as separate measurements and combined after cross sections for both of them as computed\\*
==============================\\*
Section 7.1.4 in [REFERENCE](Uncertainty due to Background Templates):\\*
    \begin{itemize}
      \item For each $I_{ch}$ range fit MC mixture and determine $b_{i}=f_{i}^{MC}/f^{MC}$, where $f^{MC}$ is MC-truth signal fraction and $f_{i}^{MC}$ - signal fraction determined from fit for the i-th Ich range
      \item Determine $U_{i}=f_{i}^{d}-b_{i}f^{d}$ where $f^{d}$ is signal fraction determined from data fit with fake template obtained from $I_{ch}$ range selected from MC closure test and $f_{i}^{d}$ is signal fraction determined from data fit with fake template obtained from i-th $I_{ch}$ range
      \item Fit $U_{i}$ distribution with Gaussian and assign sigma as systematic uncerntainty
    \end{itemize}
Appendix C. in [REFERENCE] (Extracted Signal Fraction in Jet Data and QCD MC):\\*
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Select all possible Ich ranges where QCD MC sihih template is in good agreement with MC-truth fake template taken from Drell-Yan MC ("good" means Kolmogorov-Smirnov test probability > 30\%)  
      \item Apply each of selected Ich ranges on jet-enriched dataset, use it as fake sihih template, fit data and get signal yields   
      \item Fit distribution of obtained signal yields and assign sigma as syst ucerntainty 
    \end{itemize}
Same approach used for Ipho template fits with sihih ranges\\*

NOT simply assigning difference in yields estimating from different sideband ranges.
