\subsection{MC-based computation of Acceptance X Efficiency}
Computed as combined value; Based on signal MC\\*
Numerator:\\*
For total cross section: selected signal MC yields with PU weight applied\\*
For differential cross section: selected signal MC yields with PU weight applied in phoEt GEN bins 15-20-25... Transition to phoEt RECO bins performed with unfolding\\*
Denominator:\\*
For each event in unskimmed signal MC file, photon and lepton (two leptons for Zg) which refer to Wg (Zg) and determine dR GEN and phoEt GEN\\*
For total CS: calculate number of events for which $dR_{gen}>0.7$ and $phoEt_{gen}>15$ GeV\\*
For differential CS: calculate number of events for which $dR_{gen}>0.7$ in 15-20-25... $phoEt_{gen}$ bins\\*
Computed together, bin-by-bin
