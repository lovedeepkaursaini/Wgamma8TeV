\section{Detector Resolution Unfolding}
\label{sec:Unfolding}
Performed with D'Agostini method using RooUnfold package [REFERENCE]
Checked that D'Agostini and simple inversion matrix give the same result (yields are the same, errors are different). Also checked that privetly implemented unfolding gives the same result as RooUnfold. Also the MC closure test is routinely performed every time when unfolding is applied on data. 
TODO: switch to more recent version of RooUnfold
TODO: present table: data yields; unfolded data yields; MC yeidls; unfolded MC yields; gen MC yields
TODO: think whether additional eff reco is needed here
